AdventureWorks Data Vault
Posted on 7 November 2011 by Hans Geurtsen

Recently, Dan Linstedt made available a Data Vault version of the
Adventure Works database. He has done this for SQL Server 2005/2008.
When I tried to run the corresponding script, I ran into some errors.
Constraint names were not always unique, and here and there a keyword
was used as a field name without using brackets. I got the error
'quick-and-dirty' removed, which means that I mainly to solve the
problem with the constraint names simply have used the name
"PK_<tablename>'. The modified version that works well in my SQL
Server 2008 R2 environment, you can find here. Note that the script
to be carried out in an existing (preferably blank) database. The
script only makes the tables, they are not filled! Leaving you so
empty Data Vault database for Adventure Works model. For more
information, see the original blog post by Dan Linstedt.
